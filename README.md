# couples-scoreboard

My girlfriend and I are extremely competitve, and we wanted a way to track who beats whom more in the various games we play.
We love to play word games like Scrabble, Wordle, and Word Hunt as well as the iPhone mini games Cup Pong and 8 Ball Pool.

Currently, the app allows the user to enter the results for one of those five games taking in the date, game, and score for each player.
Once a game is entered, it's added to a log file that keeps a record of all of the games we've played.

Soon, it'll allow you to see a report of results that's customized to what you want to see. You'll be able to filter by game, or look at the scores of all the games together.
For the game selected, you'll be able to see the results all time, just for this month, or select a starting and ending date for the report.

Once we have the app finished, we plan to assign point values for each win based on which game was played.
Games like Scrabble which take longer to play and require more focus would award the winner more points than a game like Cup Pong which is mindless and takes a few minutes.
At the end of each month, we'll tally up the scores and whichever of us has fewer points will have to make dinner for the winner!

I'm open to any feedback for how to enhance the app! Feel free to check it out and let me know your thoughts!
